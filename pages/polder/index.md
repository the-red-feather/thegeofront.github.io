# Polder

Polder is a historical city builder game set in the Dutch landscape of the lowlands. You step into the shoes of an ambitious mayor of a small village, a village recently ravaged by a fierce storm. Through the strategic placement of dikes, windmills, canals, canal houses, and channels, you'll gradually reclaim your village from the sea, with the ultimate aim of earning city rights. But is your settlement truly prepared to withstand the force of wild rivers and the ever-looming threat of rising tides?
