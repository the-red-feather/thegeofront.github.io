    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>We at Geofront B.V. (“Geofront”, ”we”, “our”, “us”) respect
        your privacy. With this Privacy Policy, we would like to inform you how
        we collect and process personal data. Personal data means any
        information that can, directly or indirectly, lead to an identification
        of an individual, such as their name, location, or online identifiers.
        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so you can understand how we
        handle your data.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect and process when
        you visit our website, subscribe to our newsletter or send feedback, bug
        or crash reports when playing the game titled “POLDERS” as well as
        related software such as demos and betas.</p>
    <p>For data collecting and processing purposes, the data controller is
        Geofront B.V., a company registered in the Netherlands with the identification
        number (kvk) 94676054.</p>
    <h2 id="what-information-we-collect-and-how-we-use-it">What information we collect and how we use it</h2>
    <h3 id="visiting-our-website">Visiting our website</h3>
    <p>
        Our website is hosted by GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, US. We have no direct
        control over the hosting infrastructure provided by GitHub Pages. In order to access the website, your browser
        may transmit personal data (such as your IP address) to GitHub. Your personal data is processed for the purpose
        of maintaining the functionality and security of the servers. Further information on the processing of your
        personal data by GitHub can be found here: <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement</a>.
    </p>
    <p>We do not use any cookies on our website.</p>

    <!-- <h3 id="feedback-and-bug-reports">Feedback and bug reports</h3>
    <p>When playing POLDERS, you may choose to report a bug and/or send
        us feedback using our in-game tool. This helps us make a better game and
        address issues.</p>
    <p>If you choose to send us a report, we will collect the data you
        voluntarily provide, such as save file, game screenshot, text
        description, and sheep emoji. We will also collect your game
        installation ID* as well as a timestamp and game build version. We use
        those to filter reports, and approximately determine whether any two
        reports come from the same person, or from multiple people.</p>
    <p>We store and process in-game feedback in systems operated by Hetzner
        Online GmbH, Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, Germany. We have a
        data processing agreement with this company.</p>
    <p>*The game installation ID is not connected to your Steam or other
        platform IDs, and neither is it linked to any other personal data. It is
        randomly generated on the first launch of the game.</p>
    <h3 id="crash-reports">Crash reports</h3>
    <p>When playing POLDERS, if the game encounters a problem or crashes,
        it will attempt to collect data to help us troubleshoot and fix what
        went wrong. If you agree to send us the report, we will collect the
        following data:</p>
